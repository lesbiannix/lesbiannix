## About Me

Hi there! I’m Lucy, a 19-year-old transfem nonbinary genderfluid catgirl 🏳️‍⚧️😺 (they/she).  
I’ve been tinkering with Linux since I was 9, and I’m passionate about open source, prompt engineering, and making tech more inclusive for everyone.

- **Pronouns:** she/her (but feel free to ask what I’m comfy with today!)
- **Identity:** Transfem, nonbinary, genderfluid, and proud 🏳️‍⚧️
- **Advocacy:** Fierce supporter of trans rights & LGBTQ+ visibility
